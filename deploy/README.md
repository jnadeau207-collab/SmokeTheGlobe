# Cannabis Business Suite – Extracted Code Snapshot

This zip contains the code snippets that were actually shown in the ChatGPT thread:

- Python ETL (`etl/`)
- Galaxy visualization components and store (`src/components/galaxy`, `src/hooks`, `src/store`)
- API v1 schemas and ERP endpoints (`src/app/api/v1`)
- Transparency score migration (`drizzle/migrations/0002_transparency_score.sql`)
- Dockerfiles and docker-compose for local orchestration

⚠️ Important:

The original conversation also referenced other files (e.g. full Drizzle schema, middleware, domain entities, RLS policy migration 0001). Those **weren't fully pasted as code** in the visible thread, so they are **not included here** to avoid inventing or guessing content.

This zip is therefore a faithful snapshot of the concrete code that appeared in the thread, not a complete runnable project.
